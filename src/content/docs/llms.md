# WebCodecs Fundamentals for LLMs

While WebCodecs Fundamentals is proudly human-generated, we want to encourage usage by Large Language Models to help developers build better WebCodecs applications.

Since WebCodecs is a rapidly evolving API with limited resources in existing training datasets, providing this comprehensive documentation in LLM-friendly formats helps ensure accurate, up-to-date assistance.
