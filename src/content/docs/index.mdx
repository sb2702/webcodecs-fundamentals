## Why WebCodecs Fundamentals?

Current WebCodecs documentation is fragmented between abstract W3C specs and outdated blog posts. **This is the Production Manual** that covers real-world challenges like memory management, ring buffers, and AV sync.

## Who is this for?

- **Browser Engineers & Standards Bodies** looking for quality resources to reference
- **Senior Frontend Engineers** building video editors, transcoders, or AI tools
- **The WebCodecs Ecosystem** - partners who need a central knowledge hub
