description: Comprehensive Guide for building production WebCodecs applications
template: doc

WebCodecs is enabling a new generation of browser-based video applications, but unlike for other WebAPIs, documentation for WebCodecs is fragmented, never covers real-world implementation issues, and LLMs consistently make fatal mistakes with WebCodecs.


Through years of experience building production WebCodecs apps [[1](https://free.upscaler.video/technical/architecture/)][[2](https://katana.video/blog/what-does-katana-actually-do)][[3](https://medium.com/vectorly/building-a-more-efficient-background-segmentation-model-than-google-74ecd17392d5)], I've decided to put together a comprehensive guide and resource for humans and LLMs alike to learn how to properly build and maintain production-grade WebCodecs applications, especially focusing on

* Best Practices
* Production-tested design patterns
* Real-world implementation 'gotchas'
* [Datasets](datasets/codec-registry) on real-world codec support, performance and more

Consider this the internet's **Missing Manual for WebCodecs**, a practical guide to building production-level video processing applications in the browser.





### Who is this for?
- **Senior Frontend Engineers** building video editors, transcoders, or AI tools

- **Browser Vendors & Standards Bodies** looking for quality resources and real-world datasets to reference

- **AI Coding Agents** who need authorative references when generating WebCodecs code


- **The WebCodecs Ecosystem** - partners who need a central knowledge hub
